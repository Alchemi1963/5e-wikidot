On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.</p><br><p><strong><em>Bless Water.</em></strong> You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy water.</p><br><p><strong><em>Coming of Age.</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p><br><p><strong><em>Dedication.</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god’s service.
