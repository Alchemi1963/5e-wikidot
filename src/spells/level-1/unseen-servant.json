The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.</p><br><p>If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p><br>", "chat": null, "unidentified": null}, "source": "Player's Handbook", "activation": {"type": "action", "cost": 1, "condition": null}, "duration": {"value": "1", "units": "hour"}, "cover": null, "target": {"value": null, "width": null, "units": "ft", "type": null}, "range": {"value": "60", "long": null, "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"value": null, "max": null, "per": null, "recovery": null}, "consume": {"type": null, "target": null, "amount": null}, "ability": null, "actionType": "spell", "attackBonus": null, "chatFlavor": null, "critical": {"threshold": null, "damage": null}, "damage": {"parts": [], "versatile": null}, "formula": null, "save": {"ability": null, "dc": null, "scaling": "spell"}, "level": "1", "school": "con", "components": {"vocal": true, "somatic": true, "material": true, "ritual": true, "concentration": false}, "materials": {"value": "a piece of string and a bit of wood", "consumed": false, "cost": null, "supply": 0}, "preparation": {"mode": "prepared", "prepared": "false"}, "scaling": {"mode": null, "formula": null}}, "sort": 0, "flags": {}, "img": "icons/svg/fire-shield.svg", "effects": [], "folder": null, "_stats": {"systemId": "dnd5e", "systemVersion": "2.1.0", "coreVersion": "10.291"}}
