The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p><br><p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p><br><p>Guards and Wards creates the following effects within the warded area.</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br><li><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <a href=\"spell_arcane-lock.html\">Arcane Lock</a> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <a href=\"spell_minor-illusion.html\">Minor Illusion</a> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br><li><strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <a href=\"spell_web.html\">Web</a> spell.

You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the Suggestion mentally.</li><br></ul><br></li><br></ul><br><p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <a href=\"spell_dispel-magic.html\">Dispel Magic</a> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
