It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such affects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.</p><br><p>This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p><br><p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p><br><p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><br>", "chat": null, "unidentified": null}, "source": "Player's Handbook", "activation": {"type": "hour", "cost": 1, "condition": null}, "duration": {"value": null, "units": "int"}, "cover": null, "target": {"value": null, "width": null, "units": "ft", "type": null}, "range": {"value": null, "long": null, "units": "touch"}, "uses": {"value": null, "max": null, "per": null, "recovery": null}, "consume": {"type": null, "target": null, "amount": null}, "ability": null, "actionType": "spell", "attackBonus": null, "chatFlavor": null, "critical": {"threshold": null, "damage": null}, "damage": {"parts": [], "versatile": null}, "formula": null, "save": {"ability": null, "dc": null, "scaling": "spell"}, "level": "7", "school": "nec", "components": {"vocal": true, "somatic": true, "material": true, "ritual": false, "concentration": false}, "materials": {"value": "a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes", "consumed": true, "cost": null, "supply": 0}, "preparation": {"mode": "prepared", "prepared": "false"}, "scaling": {"mode": null, "formula": null}}, "sort": 0, "flags": {}, "img": "icons/svg/fire-shield.svg", "effects": [], "folder": null, "_stats": {"systemId": "dnd5e", "systemVersion": "2.1.0", "coreVersion": "10.291"}}
